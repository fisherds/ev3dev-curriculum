"""
The goal of this module is to drive towards the beacon (the IR remote in beacon mode) and stop your robot right in front
of the beacon.  To put the IR Remote into beacon mode, press the button at the top of the remote and make sure the green
LED is on. Use channel 1 for this module.

Your program will call a function called seek_beacon that will run until the distance to the beacon is 0.  Once that
function gets the robot to that location it will stop the robot and return.  Within the main function the user will be
prompted if they want to find the beacon again (presumably you move it first) or quit.
