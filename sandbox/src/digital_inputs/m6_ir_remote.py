  This is your opportunity to work as a team on a mini-project.  You will need to handle the following actions.

  When your program starts it should say IR Remote, print instructions, and do a robot.arm_calibration

  IR remote channel 1 to drive the crawler tracks around
    - Pressing red up makes the left LED turn green and the left_motor move forward at 600.
      Releasing turns off the LED and stops left_motor.
    - Pressing red down makes the left LED turn red and the left_motor move at -600.
      Releasing turns off the LED and stops left_motor.
    - Pressing blue up makes the right LED turn green and the right_motor move forward at 600.
      Releasing turns off the LED and stops right_motor.
    - Pressing blue down makes the right LED turn red and the right_motor move at -600.
      Releasing turns off the LED and stops right_motor.
    You should be able to use one red (left) button and one blue (right) button at the same time.  For example:
     while pressing both red up and blue down the robot should spin and LEDs will be green (left) and red (right).

  IR remote channel 2 to raise and lower the arm
    - Pressing red up calls your robot.arm_up method.
    - Pressing red down calls your robot.arm_down method.
    - Pressing blue up calls your robot.arm_calibration method.

  Buttons
    - Pressing the Back button will allow your program to end.  It should stop motors, turn on both green LEDs, and
       then say and print Goodbye.  You need will implement a new robot method called shutdown to handle this task.
